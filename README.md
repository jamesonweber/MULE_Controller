# MULE Controller
Universal Windows Application to control the MULE

# Summary
The MULE (Modular Underwater Linked Explorer) is a remotely controlled underwater drone. The MULE was created as a final year interdisciplinary engineering capstone project with work from a group of mechanical, electrical, geomatics, and software engineering discipline students.

The overall solution consisted of four main components
- An operational, underwater vehicle
- A standardized system for attaching scientific data sensors
- A social network for citizen science and a database for sensor reading
- An application for remotely controlling the underwater vehicle

This git project contains the software solution for the application to remotely control the MULE.
